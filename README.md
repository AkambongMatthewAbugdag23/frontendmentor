## Overview
This is my first project with frontendmentor.io. I am using knowledge in HTML and CSS to build this project.
Onto the next one...

## My process
- I created a new repository in my github
- I created a document which had all the details of what I wanted to build systematically so I can do so accordingly.
- I created an HTML document to create the skeletal framework of my project
- I used CSS to add the finishing touches to arrive at the final piece.
- I had to make some slight changes between the styles so as to have my unique project.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development
I will be infusing Javascript frameworks into this project to make it responsive and add it to my final website piece
